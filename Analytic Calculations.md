# Charge Carrying Sources

## Point Charge
For the point charge, I used the relationship that:
E = kQ/(r^2)

## Line of Charge
For the line charge, I used the law of superposition and treated the line of charge as a series of point charges along the line. I then summed the contribution of each charge along the line to get the overall electric field induced by the line of charge at a given point.

## Plate of Charge
For the plate charge, I again used the law of superposition and treated the plate of charge as a 2D grid of point charges. I then summed the contribution of each charge in the plane to get the overall electric field induced by the plate of charge at a given point.

## Capacitor
For the capacitor, I used 2 parallel charged plates, with equal and opposite charges on either plate. I then summed the contribution of each plate to get the overall electric field induced by the capacitor at a given point.

## Current Carrying Wire
To calculate the magnetic field induced by a current-carrying wire, I used ampere's law:
B = I*mu_0*(dlxr)/(4*pi*r^2)
We then sum up the contribution from each segment, dl, to get the magnetic field induced by the charge carrying wire at a given point.

## Solenoid
The solenoid magnetic field calculations are identical to the current carrying wire calculations, with the only differnce being the orientation of dl. Instead of dl remaining in the same direction, dl curls around in a cylindrical pattern.
