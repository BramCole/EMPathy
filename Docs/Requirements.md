# Requirements Document



Highest level: iOS app with UI for selecting between lessons/demonstrations that have been prepared. 
Lesson/demonstration selection: accesses the AR environment which we have prepared using Vuforia. Access to the user's smartphone camera at this step. Tracking of actual objects/surfaces not necessary? 
AR environment: will have objects generated and placed using Unity per the physics computation. Unity links object placement/display to back-end physics computation. Unity-based interface to selct whether to show field lines, potential lines, etc. at this level?
Physics computation: Lesson plans will select between scripts prepared to position charges etc., and to calculate the position of field lines. Complexity of simulation we are able to achieve at this level will determine the lessons we make available. 





### 1. User Requirements


##### 1.1 User Characteristics  
*Provide here the characteristics of a typical user of the system (target audience). List any technical background or expected prior experience.*  

##### 1.2 System's Functionality  
*Provide here an overview of the system and what the overall intention of the system is. (goal, who is this for, ect)* 
      
##### 1.3 User Interfaces   
*Provide here a brief description of how the user will interact with the system.*

### 2. System Requirements  
*Requirements should be listed as user stories: As a <role> I can <capability>, so that <receive benefit>.*

##### 2.1 Functional Requirements
*List here the functional requirements of the system. Functional requirements are requirements that specify __what__ the system should do and can be thought of as 'the system must do <requirement\>'. Implementation details for each requirement should be addressed in the system design document. An example of a functional requirement would be 'the system utilizes Java version...' This list can become quite extensive and for best practice each requirement should be issued its own unique name, number, and be accompanied by a description. *

#####2.2 Non-Functional Requirements
*List here the non-functional requirements of the system. Non-Functional requirements are requirements that specify __how__ the system should act and can be thought of as 'the system shall be <requirement\>'. An example of a non-functional requirement would be 'the system input should be able to handle any file smaller than...'*


### 3. Not Doing

#### 3.1 Not Doing List
*list things that are out of scope or will be done at a later date*
